	<p><em>Experimental </em><em>Objective</em>-Record EEG. At the same time, Various EEG frequency components are calculated.     
    <p><br>
      <em>Calculation</em><em> method- </em>Frequency bandpass filters are used for every different frequency components of EEG.    
<p><br>
	  <em>Scientific </em><em>principle-</em> Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp produced  by the firing of neurons within the brain.  In clinical contexts,  EEG refers to the recording  of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a short period  of time, usually  20–40 minutes, as recorded  from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp.  In neurology, the main diagnostic application of EEG is in the case of epilepsy, as epileptic  activity can create clear abnormalities on a standard  EEG study<br>
The brain's electrical charge is maintained by billions  of neurons. Neurons are electrically charged  (or  &quot;polarized&quot;) by membrane transport proteins that pump ions across their membranes. When a neuron  receives a signal  from its neighbour via an action potential, it responds  by releasing ions into the space outside the cell. Ions of like charge repel each other, and when many ions are pushed out of many neurons at the same time, they can push their neighbours, who push their neighbours, and so on, in a wave. This process  is known as volume conduction. When the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp, they can push or pull electrons on the metal on the electrodes. Since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily, the difference in push, or voltage, between any two electrodes can be  measured by a voltmeter. Recording these voltages  over time gives us the EEG.<br>
Following are the frequency components:-

<p>Wave Patterns-

<p><em>Application </em><em>- </em>A routine clinical  EEG recording typically lasts 20–30 minutes (plus preparation time) and  usually involves recording from scalp electrodes. Routine EEG is typically used in the following  clinical circumstances:
<ul>
  <li>To distinguish epileptic  seizures from other types of spells,  such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, syncope (fainting), sub-cortical movement disorders  and migraine variants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To differentiate &quot;organic&quot; encephalopathy or delirium  from primary psychiatric syndromes such as  catatonia</li>
  <li>To serve as an adjunct test of brain  death</li>
  <li>To prognosticate, in certain  instances, in patients  with coma</li>
  <li>To determine whether  to wean anti-epileptic medications</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times, a  routine EEG is not sufficient, particularly when  it is necessary to  record a patient while he/she  is having  a seizure. In this case,  the  patient may  be admitted  to the hospital for days  or even weeks, while EEG  is constantly being  recorded (along with time-synchronized video and audio recording). A recording of an actual seizure (i.e.,  an ictal recording,  rather than an inter-ictal recording of a possibly epileptic  patient at some period  between seizures) can give  significantly better information  about whether or not  a spell  is an epileptic seizure and the  focus in the brain from which the  seizure activity emanates.</p>
