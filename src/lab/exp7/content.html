	<p><em>Experimental</em><em> Objective</em>- Record the EEG. At the same time, the root-mean-squared of the alpha rhythm  (alpha-RMS) will be calculated. Alpha-RMS is the index of the activity  levels of the alpha rhythm.    
    <p><em>Calculation </em><em>method- </em>Alpha RMS is the windowed  root mean square value of the alpha EEG signal  using a window width of 0.25  seconds.</p>
    <p><em>Scientific </em><em>principle-</em>Brain activity is related  to ions and charge movement, this activity can be detected  by electrodes. The record of the brain's activity is called an electroencephalogram (EEG) from the root  words of electro (electrical), encephalo (brain), and  gram (record).<br>
      The EEG records the electrical activity on the surface of the cerebral  cortex. The EEG is complex  and variable between  adults, although  under certain  conditions, the EEG exhibits  simpler, rhythmic activity. Simpler patterns in the EEG occur when many cells synchronize their input to the surface  of the cerebral cortex. The  more synchronized the charge movement, the more rhythmic  the EEG.<br>
      EEG changes as a person grows. The development of EEG is rapid with new-borns. As neural  development proceeds, the EEG recorded from the posterior regions of the brain of an infant of 3-4 months begins to resemble EEGs recorded from the posterior region of adults. The difference is that the 3-4 month old infants have EEGs in the frequency range of 3-4 Hz, whereas adults tend to have average frequencies of 10 Hz. By the time the infant is one year old, the posterior region EEG is approximately 6 Hz, by three years, 8 Hz, and by 13-14 years (puberty), the average frequency is 10 Hz (similar to adults).<br>
      One of the simpler patterns is the alpha rhythm.  The alpha rhythm is  characterized by a frequency of 8-13 Hz and amplitudes of 20-200 uV. Each region  of the brain has a characteristic frequency of alpha rhythm. Alpha waves of the greatest amplitude tend to be recorded  from the occipital and parietal regions of the  cerebral cortex.<br>
      Just as the EEG is variable depending on the mental state of an individual, the frequency  and amplitude of alpha rhythms  within an individual change. In general,  the alpha rhythm is the prominent  EEG wave pattern of an adult in a relaxed, inattentive state with eyes closed. More specific  conditions of alpha rhythms  are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breathing- Hyperventilation (breathing abnormally quickly and deeply) causes the gas composition of the blood to  change. During  hyperventilation, the carbon dioxide levels  of the blood fall, pH levels increase, and blood pressure decreases. These effects of hyperventilation are associated with changes  in brainwave activity.  With hyperventilation, the overall  electrical activity of the brain increases, with the amplitude of the alpha rhythms often increasing as well.</li>
      <li>Gender- Females tend  to have higher mean frequencies of alpha waves than males, although  the differences are small.</li>
      <li>Memory- Frequency may affect the speed of &quot;remembering&quot; during memory tests and may be  approximately 1 Hz higher for high-scoring  subjects than subjects who scored lower.</li>
      <li>Personality- Amplitudes tend to be higher in subjects who are more &quot;outgoing&quot; and extroverted.</li>
      <li>Mental Stress- Amplitudes vary with the difficulty of mental tasks performed with the eyes closed.</li>
      <li>Desynchronization- Amplitudes of alpha waves diminish when subjects  open their eyes and are attentive  to external stimuli. Thus, instead of getting the wave-like synchronized pattern of alpha waves,  desynchronization occurs.</li>
      <li>Biorhythms-Amplitudes increase when subjects  are less alert and tend to be higher  from 1:30- 4:30  p.m.</li>
  </ul>
