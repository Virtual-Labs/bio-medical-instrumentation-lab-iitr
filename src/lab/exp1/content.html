	<p><em>Experimental </em><em>Objective</em>- Record ECG of various  leads. And at the same time observe  various changes caused  due change in lead combinations.
	<p><br>
	  <em>Calculation</em><em> method- </em>A custom  circuit board containing relays  is made which is attached between the simulator and the Biopac  MP150, which is used to change  the lead combinations. 
	<p><br>
	  <em>Scientific </em><em>principle-</em>An ECG is a series  of waves and deflections recording the heart&rsquo;s  electrical activity from a certain view. Each part of wave corresponds to particular action in heart as shown. Many views, each called a lead, monitor voltage changes between electrodes placed in different position on the body.<br>
	  The interior of the cell membrane is considered to be  negative with respect  to outside during resting conditions. When an electric  impulse is generated  in the heart,  the interior part becomes  positive with respect to the exterior.  This change of polarity  is called depolarisation. After depolarisation the cell comes back to its original state. This phenomenon is called  repolarisation. The ECG records the electrical signal of the  heart as the muscle depolarize (contract) and repolarize.            
    <p><br>

     <p>The SA node is the basic, natural cardiac pacemaker  that triggers its own train of action potentials. The action potential of the SA node propagates through the rest of the heart, causing  a particular pattern of excitation and contraction. The sequence of events and waves in cardiac cycle is as follow  :    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The SA node fires.</li>
    
      <li>Electrical activity is propagated through the atrial musculature at comparatively low rates, causing slow –moving depolarization (contraction) of the atria. This results  in the P wave in the ECG. Due to the slow contraction of the atria  and their small size, the P wave is a slow, low amplitude wave, with an amplitude of about 0.1-0.2 mV and  a duration of about  60-80 ms.</li>
      <li>The excitation wave faces a propagation delay at the atrio- ventricular (AV) node, which results in a normally iso-electric segment of about 60-80 ms after the P wave in ECG, known as the PQ segment. The pause assists  in the completion of the transfer of blood from the atria to the ventricles.</li>
      <li>The bundle, the bundle branch and the purkinje system of specialized conduction fibers propagate the stimulus to the ventricles at the  high rate.</li>
      <li>The wave of stimulus  spread from the apex of the heart upwards,  causing rapid depolarization (contraction) of the ventricles. This results in the QRS wave of the ECG- a sharp triphasic wave of about  1mV  amplitude and 80 ms duration.</li>
      <li>Ventricles muscle cells possess a relatively long action potential duration of about 300-350  ms. The plateau of the action potential causes normally iso-electric segment of about of the 100- 120 ms  after the QRS, known as the ST  segment.</li>
      <li>Repolarization (relaxation) of the ventricles causes the slow T wave, with an amplitude of 0.1-0.3 mV and duration of 120-160  ms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="images/Image_002.jpg" alt="" style="width:392px;height:589px" align="middle"/>        
    <p>In ECG lead refers  to the  voltage between two electrodes. In 12  Lead ECG total  10 surface electrodes are attached  to various specified positions on the body as shown in the figure 2. A suitable  gel is used to provide impedance match between the electrodes and the skin. The 10 electrodes are classified as: 4 limb electrodes, Right Arm (RA), Left Arm (LA), Left Leg (LL) and Right Leg (RL); and 6 chest electrodes, V1-V6.

    <p>A total of 12 Leads are derived from these 10 electrodes. These 12 leads are classified as 3 limb leads, 3 augmented  limb leads and 6 precordial leads. Out of this 12 leads, limb leads are bipolar while all other leads  are unipolar leads. The definition  for all 12 leads  is as follows:-</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead I – is the  signal between negative RA and positive LA electrodes.</li>
      <li>Lead II – is the signal  between negative RA and positive  LL electrodes.</li>
      <li>Lead III – is the signal  between negative LA and  positive LL electrodes.</li>
    </ul>
    <br clear="all">
<p><img src="images/Image_003.jpg" alt="" style="width:375px;height:246px" align="middle"/></p>
<p>These three limb  leads form the points of  what is known as Einthoven's triangle  as shown in figure 3,  which is the theoretical triangle drawn around the heart with heart at centre. According to Einthoven&rsquo;s law,<br>
Lead I – Lead II + Lead III  = 0.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lead aVR or Augmented vector right – is the signal between  the positive electrode on the right arm and the negative electrode which is a combination of the left arm electrode  and the left leg electrode.</li>
  <li>Lead aVL or augmented  vector left – is the signal between  the positive electrode  on the left arm and the negative electrode which is a combination of the right arm electrode and the left leg  electrode.</li>
  <li>Lead aVF or Augmented  vector foot – is the  signal between the positive electrode on the left leg and the negative electrode  which is a combination of the right arm electrode  and  the left arm electrode.</li>
  <li>Precordial leads V1-V6 – is the signal between the corresponding positive V1-V6 electrode on the chest and the negative  electrode formed by the Wilson terminal obtained by adding three  limb leads.</li>
  <li>(Note: Wilson terminal is formed by the average  of the 3 limb leads and approximate ground. This  is possible because of Einthoven's  Law  which states that I + (-II) + III = 0.)          </li>
