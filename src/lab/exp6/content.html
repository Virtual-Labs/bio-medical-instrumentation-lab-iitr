	<p><em>Experimental </em><em>Objective</em>- - Record the EEG. At the same time, approximate entropy of 5 epochs of width  &ldquo;0.2 sec&rdquo; each are  calculated.
	<p><em>Calculation </em><em>method-</em>Approximate entropy is a ``regularity statistic'' that quantifies the unpredictability of fluctuations  in a time series such as an instantaneous  heart rate time series.    
    <p><em>Scientific </em><em>principle-</em>Brain activity is related  to ions and charge movement, this activity can be detected  by electrodes. The record of the brain's activity is called an electroencephalogram (EEG) from the root  words of electro (electrical), encephalo (brain), and  gram (record).<br>
      The EEG records the electrical activity on the surface of the cerebral  cortex. The EEG is complex  and variable between  adults, although  under certain  conditions, the EEG exhibits  simpler, rhythmic activity. Simpler patterns in the EEG occur when many cells synchronize their input to the surface  of the cerebral cortex. The  more synchronized the charge movement, the more rhythmic  the EEG.<br>
      EEG changes as a person grows. The development of EEG is rapid with new-borns. As neural  development proceeds, the EEG recorded from the posterior regions of the brain of an infant of 3-4 months begins to resemble EEGs recorded from the posterior region of adults. The difference is that the 3-4 month old infants have EEGs in the frequency range of 3-4 Hz, whereas adults tend to have average frequencies of 10 Hz. By the time the infant is one year old, the posterior region EEG is approximately 6 Hz, by three years, 8 Hz, and by 13-14 years (puberty), the average frequency is 10 Hz (similar to adults).<br>
      Approximate entropy is a statistical measure that attempts to quantify the predictability of a data sequence. A perfectly  predictable data series (such as a pure sine wave) has an approximate entropy of zero. Several  studies are beginning  to examine approximate entropy of EEG data and its relationship to  external factors, such as drugs  and sleep  states.<br>
      A low approximate entropy value (meaning that the EEG recording is regular  and predictable) indicates the anaesthetized state of the subject. A high approximate entropy value (meaning that the EEG recording is irregular  and unpredictable) indicates that the subject is conscious. Approximate entropy is defined  as the unpredictability of subsequent samples in a time series based on the knowledge of previous  samples.<br>
      Advantages of approximate entropy-</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lower computational demand. Approximate entropy can be designed to work for small data samples  (n &lt; 50  points) and can be applied  in real time.</li>
      <li>Less effect from noise. If data are noisy,  the approximate entropy  measure can be compared to the noise level in the data to determine what quality of true information may be present  in the data.          </li>
    </ol>
          <p><em>Application</em><em>- </em>It has been applied  to classify EEG in psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and  addiction.</p>
